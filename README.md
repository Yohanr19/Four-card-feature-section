# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

Four Card Feature Section challenger by Frontend Mentor coded by YohanR19

*I managed to do this one much quicker than usual (around 1 hour)
I don't know if this challenge was just easy or maybe i am getting
better at creating responsive desings quicker (I hope its the second).
Had a lot of fun regardless and i keep flexing my grid skills, which is
ironically more ''flexible'' than flex display in my opinion.
